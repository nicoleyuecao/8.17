        countrysides begins their urbanization. Some people hold that we should deter the rural form this type of development. while others believe that it is necessary for us to foster this procession. I think that we should interfere the villages from the urbanization, because it destroies the environment and endanger people’s health condition.
         By urbanizing, our surroundings will be damaged, and it’s hard to recover. In the past, my hometown was a wonderful place, where covered by the flourish trees and clean river. However, when the urbanization started on the my village, it all changed. Water in the river become dirty and the tree of the wooden disappeared. rural in our country are facing the same problem, but we cannot stop the urbanization’s happen, because it is acted by the country's policy . In short, urbanizing will take our terrific hometown away from us, and we need to deter it.
         In addition, urbanization will do harm to people's health. The end of urbanization, people living in this place have to find a job in a company to make a living, because urbanization makes them can only work for the company, not in the field. Unfortunately, during the whole day's work, they seldom move or go out for a walk, instead, they sit in front of the computer. Therefore, urbanization has caused people's sub-health state, which seriously affects people's health. In short, urbanization has a profound impact on human health.
        To sum up, although urbanization can bring us convenience and quality of life, it also brings us substandard environment and healthy conditions. So, let's enjoy the unurbanized life and keep it like this forever!
